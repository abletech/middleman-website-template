# Middleman4 + Webpack template

This repo is structured as a Middleman Template.

If you've never used a template to initialise a Middleman project, head over to [middlemanapp.com/…/project-templates](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/project-templates/) to find out how to they work.

## Setup

### Install Middleman

First, get [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) installed.

```
gem install middleman
```

### Initialise from this project template

Then in your parent directory…

```
middleman init PROJECT_NAME -T AbleTech/middleman-website-template
```

Middleman will then use this repo as your new project template.

### Installing further dependencies

Change to your new project directory…

```
cd PROJECT_NAME
```

…and install any further dependencies:

```
npm i
```

## Next steps

Now check out `README.md` in your project directory.
